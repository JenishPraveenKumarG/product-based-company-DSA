In array elements will be stored contegueously whereas in linkedlist it wont be stored contegueously

that is the main difference between array and linkedlist

And then we can change the length of the linkedlist
in languages like java and c++ we will declare the size first and we cant modify it.

in linkedlist we have starting point as head
and the next element will be pointed via next

we will stop when next is null and the point is called as tail
